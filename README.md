Minimum Android version: 5.0 (Lollipop)

### What is it?
Account Diary is an offline android app that allows the user to quickly view important account information, 
from any account they have ever created for any platform/organization/game/software etc., 
directly from their phone in an organized way.

The app simply links buttons (in the app) to images stored on the phone, 
just so the user can quickly access these images on the fly. Yes, that's all the app does.

### How does it work?
On opening the app, the user will see a list of each letter in the Swedish alphabet.
Opening the section for a letter will show a list of buttons for every account beginning with that letter. 
Pressing these account buttons will show the images associated with the account. 

The user can add/delete account buttons, 
and assign images of their choosing to these buttons as they please.


### Who is this app for?
* Old-school people (or boomers) who write passwords and other vital account information on physical paper, 
  but don't want to bring these notes with them everywhere they go. 
* Me.
* Possibly you.

### In what situations is this app useful?
* When you don't want to bring the notes containing your account information with you everytime you leave the house.
* When you forget the Netflix password while on a long train ride.
* When you forget any password while not at home, really.
